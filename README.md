## What is it?
owoblecto is a media server, which streams media you already own, and is designed to be at the heart of your entertainment experience. It runs on your home server to index and analyze your media such as Movies and TV Shows and presents them in an interface tailored for your media consupmtion needs.

## How do I set this up?
owoblecto can be installed using NPM or directly from GIT. We recommend you to install from npm if you do not intend to help with development.

Please follow the setup and installation guide here: https://github.com/robinp7720/owoblecto/wiki/Getting-Started

If you have further questions or need help setting up owoblecto, please don't hesitate to ask in the gitter chat! owoblecto should be easy to install for everyone. If it doesn't achieve this, improvments must be made!

## I've set this thing up. Now where's the place I actually watch my media?
Simply go to the owoblecto front end at ```localhost:8080```. owoblecto will redirect you to the frontend. The frontend is maintained sepperatly at https://github.com/robinp7720/owoblecto-Web
